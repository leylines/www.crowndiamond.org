			. . . our vision darkened by the prisms through

			<img alt="" class="auto-style139" height="422" src="davidbones..gif" style="float: right" width="228" /></span></em>As the revelations that brought this book began to unfold in my life, 
		I was on the threshold of a new understanding of scripture and the ways 
		of <span><span class="auto-style141"><a href="../Dict/y/yh_yz/yh.html">hy</a></span>. </span>I'd heard 
		rumors of the mystical kabbalah, but I supposed that its secrets were 
		contained in a single book, somewhere; and I had vainly tried to locate 
		a copy for my personal education, without success. Imagine my surprise, 
		then, when I found its diverse systems rushing upon me like a mighty 
		flood: a good while before any kabbalistic text was given into my hand</p>
		<p>Fool that I was and am, I was still a novice concerning accepted 
		scripture when the eclectic teachings of kabbalah came in response to my 
		call for awareness of their existence! I found myself standing with one 
		leg in the realm of literal understandings and the other in the realm of 
		spiritual interpretations; and I had many opportunities to thank the 
		Father of Light that he had founded me on the Rock that underlies all 
		sound interpretation some thirteen years before I began intensive study 
		of the accepted canon.</p>
		<p>It seems important, to me, that I confess my lack of sophistication 
		with regards to scriptural interpretation, in general, when this phase 
		of my experience began to unfold in my life. The background is not of 
		great significance in itself, nor even unusual. One would expect novices 
		to be unschooled. Details of my lack of preparation wouldn't be 
		expedient; but those unfamiliar with kabbalah should know that these 
		pages were not entrusted to a kabbalistic apologist, but to one who-- 
		just three years previous to writing about these things-- was, himself, 
		reluctant to take up this arm of mysticism.</p>
		<p>In prayer for guidance at the beginning of committed study of 
		scripture and my cautious inquiry into the value of kabbalah, I was 
		admonished by the Small Voice: namely, ImmanuAL;<span> </span>
		<a href="../Matthew/Matthew2.html"><span class="auto-style141">owcwhy</span> Yahushua</a>: 
		Angel of the Presence, "If I open a door for you, you ought to go 
		through it!" Amazed at the gentle rebuke for my lack of faith, I 
		determined in myself to abandon-- once and for all (I thought)-- the 
		paths I had imagined that I ought to be taking; and to take daily, as I 
		should be enabled, those steps prepared for me from above, if only I 
		could recognize them and actually do them: "Sufficient unto the day," as 
		it's written.</p>
		<p>Immediately upon settling my will on obedience, I began receiving 
		visions of lines written upon my soul-- such as David must have seen 
		when he received the pattern for the first temple at Jerusalem. One of 
		my first impressions, when introduced to traditional representations of
		<a href="adam.html">Adam </a><a href="adam.html" target="_blank">Kadmon</a>, 
		was that the symbol was, in some way, incomplete. Not knowing why, I had 
		begun extending its lines beyond their usual limits. Now, I saw in the 
		Spirit that those lines were leading somewhere specific, or to some 
		specific thing-- a new or greater or more complete symbol and 
		revelation: but if not new, then a restoration of something very old, 
		indeed.</p>
		<p>Its origins unknown, to my knowledge, Adam Kadmon is an ancient 
		symbol of the First Adam, whose design was in the likeness, the image, 
		of the Elohim and of the Second Adam, a pattern in which spiritual men 
		can discern the clear imprint of the Complete Adam. These pages present 
		the symbol of the Life Tree both in its familiar form and in its 
		expanded form of young foliage, the Crown Diamond. Know, therefore, that 
		full summer of the Davidic Kingdom is, even now, at the very doors.</p>
		<p>To differentiate between the Adam Kadmon of tradition and its 
		extended portrayal in this work, Michael Murphy, the elder with whom I 
		was working when the vision began to unfold, named the diagram of the 
		interlocking Trees of Life, calling it "The Crown Diamond of the 
		Believers' Tree of Life"; and by that name do I make it known. "Crown" 
		refers to the first emanation of Adam Kadmon, which is called Kether in 
		the Hebrew tongue, and as "Supreme Crown" in English usage.</p>
		<p>The diagrams collected into earlier editions of the Crown Diamond 
		book and into these html pages are being presented in this medium to aid 
		those called into the dimensions and applications of the symbol of the 
		Tree of Life. Studies of the sacred Tree-- and these pages merely 
		present symbolic representations of that Reality, which are by no means 
		to be mistaken for the Life Tree, Itself-- are lawful for all who have 
		risen from the dead-- from their carnal understandings (Matt. 17:9, and 
		who have also overcome in the <a href="ephesus.html" target="_blank">
		Church of Asia at Ephesus</a>. The study is lawful for those who are 
		fully devoted to the spiritual life <span class="auto-style1">(Rev. 2:7)</span>.</p>
		<p>Such a one will look upon these symbols in prayer, trusting that the 
		Spirit of Truth will reveal the twelve manners of fruits in their 
		seasons. He will not struggle idolatrously to attain insights <span class="auto-style1">(1 Tim. 
		4:8)</span>, but will rest in the blessings given into his hands. This is the 
		manner of supplicants who wait upon the blessing of hwhy; for "it is not 
		for man to direct his steps."</p>
		<p>To paraphrase the words of the author of The Zohar to students 
		engaged in studies of Adam Kadmon, "Blessed is he who has entered 
		therein and departed therefrom, but cursed be he who enters therein and 
		does not depart therefrom; it would be better for him if he had never 
		been born." The carnal mind cannot learn the secret things of Elohim by 
		this presentation or by study and application of any human contrivance. 
		The Tabernacle of David, a temple being built without hands, is rebuilt 
		in the Spirit: within the Breath of we who breathe.</p>
		<p>The purpose of this work is simply to present the fruit of the Spirit 
		as it has been received; for the fruit contains the seed, as elder
		<a href="http://www.bethashem.org" target="_blank">Shmuel</a> teaches, 
		"the seed: which, finding fertile soil, will raise unto the Life that 
		begat it yet more abundant life." Any insights, revelations, and 
		applications derived from reception of this study in years or ages to 
		come, it is therefore understood, must be received in harmony with both 
		Holy Scripture and the indwelling witness of the Holy Spirit. That is 
		the way of kabbalah.</p>
		<p>Genesis 15:19 tells us that the land of the
		<a href="howl.html" target="_blank">Kadmonites</a> (those who study the 
		Projection of Adam) is given unto Avraham and to his seed, the Body of 
		Messiah. To inherit this spiritual land as a lasting possession, it must 
		be stressed, one must adhere to the teachings of the Second Adam, who 
		pointed the way to the true Door within the holy of holies, which lies 
		in the Yahrushalem that is above: the City of David, the Chamber of the 
		High Father-- His Meeting Place, the bosom of Father Avraham. Some other 
		focus, as upon the symbols themselves, will end in the distortions of 
		idolatry, the invalidations of Truth.</p>
		<p>It is not the purpose of this work to develop a cohesive system of 
		interpretation, though many interpretations are included herein, and not 
		without system. Interpretations belong to hwhy and come by the Breath, 
		through whatever means he might choose. Nor is the purpose of this book 
		to generate applications, which also belong to HaShem, and which shall 
		unfold by his Wisdom in due course. Yet more, it is not this work's 
		purpose to present every insight expedient for understanding the 
		symbols, themselves, which purpose shall be fulfilled by the ongoing 
		guidance of the Spirit of Truth. John the Revelator has testified that 
		the twelve manners of fruit come in their seasons-- in their times.</p>
