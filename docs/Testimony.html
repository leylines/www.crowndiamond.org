		<td class="auto-style5" colspan="3">I'm 80. I've walked in the baptism 
		of fire, beyond and including the baptism of spirit, for fifty-four 
		years. I testify to this board that I am One with the Angel of the 
		Presence, whose Hebrew name in English letters is Yahushua. He is the 
		bridegroom, the Word, the Projection of the Father into the created 
		realms of Heaven (the immortal realm) and Earth (the mortal realm). I am 
		One, also, with Y'shua, the man of Matthew 1:16. He is my elder brother 
		and stands at the right hand of the heavenly throne but positions also 
		within the "heart," the earthly throne. <br />
		<br />
		Yahushua is the Projection of the Father, called Yah in English. He does 
		what the Father does. Above the heavenly throne is the portal to the 
		eternal realm, in which our Father sits with the Ancient of Days, 
		resting comfortably. The Shema can be translated accurately as ". . . 
		YHWH your Gods is one YHWH. "Gods" not because there are two, but 
		because אל (masc.) and אלה (fem) are One , whose Name is יהוה YHWH. In 
		the beginning, before the separation Adam/Man was made in the image, the 
		likeness of אלהים Elohim, the Gods. This is our true nature: male and 
		female created he them.<br />
		<br />
		"Realized beings," in my opinion, have rediscovered within themselves 
		their true nature, but they mischaracterize it as God because it is in 
		the likeness, after the image of God. Of these it might be said (though 
		I would not be one to say it, for I don't know) that they should 
		reconsider; for the man of Galilee taught us that it's enough for the 
		servant be AS his Lord, the friend as his friend. <br />
		<br />
		As I say, I received the fire baptism, which I've only lately 
		understood. For thirteen years after the event I wasn't sure what had 
		happened at all; for it happened on a poker table. When, after thirteen 
		years I received water baptism, I understood the first immersion as the 
		Spirit immersion, but I was mistaken; and it's taken me fifty-four years 
		to understand the fullness of the blessing I received after I left 
		everything and everyone behind and took to the streets, looking for 
		Jesus.<br />
		<br />
		Fifty-four years have passed. I now know and understand the Hebrew 
		names, whose distinctions are important. Fifty-four years, and I'm still 
		not a "realized being" to my own understanding; but I realize this: I 
		know and I am known by the heavenly host. Nothing can make me afraid, 
		although the creature may be subject to fear. <br />
		<br />
		I've understood that there are four realms, as relates to the many 
		groupings of four in scripture and as relates to the four elements of 
		the ancients: there's the eternal realm, the immortal realm, the mortal 
		realm, and the everlasting realm.<br />
		<br />
		The difference between the immortal realm and the everlasting realm is 
		understood in this saying, "The Heavens are not clean in his sight." In 
		the everlasting realm all appear without spot or blemish, no longer 
		having need to go in and out, as it says in the message to the Church at 
		Laodicea (which is within all who inhabit the mortal realm).<br />
		<br />
		I've said enough. The details of my testimony, in pdf format,
