		<td colspan="3"><span class="auto-style107">A friend posted this in social media, and I felt the 
		need to respond; so here is what I wrote:<br />
		<br />
		&nbsp;I remember. I truly do; and when I doubt it, there's a dream or a word 
		confirming it. There's no escape. The angels were assembled, and the 
		Presence said whom shall I send? There was an uncomfortable pause, and 
		everyone else was turning away, and the focus fell on me. What else 
		could I do?! I had to say it; for it was clearly expected of me to say 
		something. I said, "Send me." Now, don't think I therefore claim to be 
		messiah; for I am not. My job is to find the tools and demonstrate their 
		use. That I have done. I'm eighty in two months. My success or failure 
		is not in my hands, but in yours. </span> <a href="https://crowndiamond.org">

		<br />
		This is the answer I received: "I'm very challenged. There are ones who 
		don't want me to overcome."<br />
		<br />
		I knew my answer had to be spontaneous, not contrived; and this is what 
		came out:<br />
		<br />
		Allow me to share a thought that's not yet complete: "When you shall see 
		the abomination that causes desolation standing in the holy place? The 
		one who gives his power to the beast? Against which none can wage war?" 
		Why stand you gazing into the heavens or into the murky conflicts of 
		Earth? Your view to heaven will be blocked. That's a door no man can 
		open. Your view of Earth will find no lasting focus: Is it Putin, 
		Netanyahu, Charlemagne? Yes, but certainly no; for that's a deadly game 
		of unmusical chairs. There is prophecy. All prophecy is fulfilled within 
		you; for it's written, whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; but 
		only if your focus is without. There is prophecy, and there is the 
		effect of every vision. Charlemagne was an effect, Putin, Trump, the 
		good Queen James. Poor twisted souls! They may have the power of the 
		warhead, but they're driven by the darkness in their souls: powerless 
		except for the void that passes through them. When you see him standing 
		in the holy place where he ought not be? The place where your soul is 
		still virginal, clean, untouched, hammered daily but standing strong 
		beyond all possibility of understanding? When you see him standing 
		there, it is you: the shadow you; the rational you; the 
		obedient/disobedient-but-always-driven you. It's your rational mind, and 
		it gives its power to the beast: literally, the beast, your physical 
		body. It refuses to let go. It's Pharaoh of old, and should you break 
		free and head for the wilderness where you can sort things out and get 
		things straight, it will surely follow you. But hey! Take it to Yardan 
		and the baptism of Yahuchanan, the baptism of repentance. Repentance 
		isn't regret. It's surrender. Abject surrender. It's not for man to 
		direct his steps. As sensible as it is, you can't take the bit between 
		your teeth. Like Jeremiah says, "Turn us, and we shall be turned." You 
		can't even turn yourself. The only thing you can do is make a gesture, 
		like Queen Ester. Acknowledge the Presence, even if you can't spot it 
		for the moment. Claim your right to be chariot of the Presence. That's 
		it. Do that, and it is done.<br />
		<br />
		Reading it now, my thought is, "We believe; help free us of unbelief. We 
		would turn, but we just can't manage it on our own. We hear the pipes 
		and see the dancing. We need the touch upon the shoulder, inviting us to 
		join in, taking the lead. Turn us, and we will be turned.</span></td>
