		<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Men of Galilee! Why stand ye here, gazing into the heavens? 
		This same . . ."<br />
		<br />
		</strong>Most of my life, I thought that the saying "I shall give you to 
		eat of the Tree of Life" referred, exclusively, to some future time, but 
		that was only when I saw mankind as having three faces: body, soul, and 
		spirit.<br />
		<br />
		The saying, that the Tree of Life has "twelve manner of fruit, in its 
		seasons" kept nagging at my understanding. Then I realized that man has 
		four faces, not three: that in addition to body, soul, and spirit, there 
		is the angel. The clue, for me, was in the teachings concerning Elijah; 
		and I wrote those thoughts down <a href="../cd/scarlet.html">here</a>. 
		Then, I remembered the scripture, take care that you do not offend one 
		of these little ones that believes in me; for their angels do always 
		behold the face of their Father, in heaven. That means, that as I type 
		this and as you, later, read this, our angels are looking directly at 
		the throne in the third heaven. We're worms that die not: we're like 
		unto caterpillars. We experience a kind of death, but no finishing end; 
		for our angels partake of the Tree of Life that's in heaven.<br />
		<br />
		If that's the case, it means that we are already eating of the Tree's 
		fruit. Lo, and behold, the <a href="../cd/alpha.html">alphabets of 
		mankind</a>! Every note ever written and thrown away, as well as every 
		scripture, bears witness of the fruit of the Tree! I we're accustomed 
		to other such fruit, but there's no need to pursue the arguments. It's 
		enough to know that, though king David is buried and in his tomb, he 
		lives, along with so many others; and that I will one day fellowship 
		with the saints.<br />
		<br />
		And as concerning the saints, that they neither marry nor are given in 
		marriage, but are as the angels: The angels shouted for joy at the 
		creation of man! The reason? Mankind would give them opportunity to 
		qualify for celestial bodies, the same celestial bodies promised those 
		who, living and dying as man, overcome: being sustained by the 
		nourishment that comes down from heaven at this very moment, for those 
		to whom it is given. We're only a <em>little</em> lower than the angels 
		at this present time, which is why in times past angels wed humans; and 
		how, in this present time, those with eyes to see and ears to hear see 
		the angels of heaven ascending and descending on the Sons of Man.<br />
		<br />
		Note: "ascending" is said before "descending." Ye men of Galilee! Why 
		stand you here, gazing into the heavens!<br />
