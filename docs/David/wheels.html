		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">Among believers within 
		Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, it is generally believed that the 
		writings are historical documents, and that much of what is written has 
		contextual value for those who are learning of God’s ways, but that the 
		narratives that began with Adam and reach their zenith in the words of 
		the prophets; that began with the genealogy of a man from Galilee, whose 
		words are essentially sealed by the writings of his disciples; that the 
		writings of Mohammed speak to the future of the faith but pertain to his 
		time on Earth, and that his assertion that all Muslims are bound to the 
		Hebrew and Greek canons has narrow application. </span> <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">The book of Revelation 
		is an anomaly of sorts, because it reworks what seems to have passed and 
		leapfrogs into these and imminently approaching times. The scriptures 
		depict wheels within wheels, and if translation is faithful to the 
		Spirit that drove its authors to write, it is not possible to defend 
		what is written in one place without affirming its relevance to what is 
		written in every place. Paul and others hinted at this, when saying such 
		things as the first Adam was a type of the second, and that Eve was a 
		type of the church.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>My view is 
		that every narrative of Tanakh unfolds the Garden narrative within 
		ever-expanding contexts: to the extent that, after the Exodus from 
		Egypt, every move of the camps of Yisroel in the wake of the cloud by 
		day and the fire by night is reiteration of the Adamic cycle: the same 
		story is being told, over and over again, but each revisitation both 
		adds depth to the original and opens doors to its interpretation that 
		are easily overlooked.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">
		<o:p>I</o:p>t is said that the wise man will say of the scriptures, they 
		are of a book that is sealed. I understand this to mean that the lively 
		oracles of HaShem were sealed when the Separatists and the Soferim took 
		away the key to knowledge under Ezra, when the modern Hebrew script 
		replaced Sinaitic Hebrew. An unintended consequence is that, with the 
		later work of the Masoretes, the world has studied what amounts to a 
		translation into Aramaic.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">Don’t get me wrong. 
		There is nothing in the received text that I don’t treasure. Further, 
		without the protective invention of the Ezra script during the 
		Babylonian captivity; without the blueprint of the careful work of the 
		Masoretes in applying the Oral Tradition to what is written, all of us 
		would have been clueless about Torah and the writings it engendered, the 
		Greek scriptures and the Holy Quran included. We would be asea within 
		the lively oracles of God without a rudder.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">We find ourselves, in 
		this late day, on the verge of the restoration of all things: a time 
		when seals are to be broken. Many pertain to the end of this age; but of 
		those which point to the future, none is more important than the seal 
		upon the Hebrew scriptures. That seal has been broken: once again, Torah 
		is available as a lively oracle, as first delivered to Yisroel by Moshe 
		from Saini and developed within his tent with the guidance of Yahushua, 
		and the assistance of lowly Hosea, who was renamed Y’shua, for he would 
		lead in the battle of Yircho and set foot beyond Yardan. </span> <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
		Y’shua led a nation state, but he was met by the angel Yahushua, who 
		proclaimed, in answer to the question of whether he was friend or foe, 
		“Nay, but as captain of the Hosts of HaShem have I come.” In this 
		meeting before Yircho is pictured the mystery of Matthew 1:1 and 1:16, 
		except the figure of Hosea is not only renamed, but born again: the 
		first of many brethren.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="auto-style108">The lively oracles of 
		HaShem Y<span class="auto-style66">HWH</span> are being restored in our 
		day. Torah and the Hebrew canon are again available in Sinaitic Hebrew, 
		a language of pictographic emblems that answer to the question in the 
		mind of the reader, but only by the Holy Spirit. The intellect can make 
		dry runs at working out what is written, and that is quite useful so 
		long as the reader is clinging to the received text and its translations 
		into the languages of the world; for the oracles support what is 
		received. However, the original emblems break the seal, in preparation 
		for the words, “I will magnify Torah and make it glorious.” Torah is not 
		one story. It is story upon story upon story, all turning around the 
		same hub, the same cornerstone, the Word of HaShem; and eternity will 
		fill with its ramifications. </span>
