Creation therefore began as the projection of a word, along with the thoughts to which it gave form. This understanding is echoed in the teachings of John the Baptist, who taught that the Word of HaShem was projected into the void, breaking the surface tension of the deep and seeding it with the thoughts of HaShem.<br><br>The pattern within Creation’s variety of forms speaks of unity within differentiation; and that pattern is the Logos, the Word, the Primal Thought. The body of thought, Creation is the spiritual projection of the Essence of HaShem: it was born into the temporal realm by

At its first instant, the temporal realm would be permeated by dualisms, such as “before” and “after”; and so, the spirit of HaShem hovered against its fluidity. The Creator began to shape and order the cosmos by the power of words, which would accomplish his intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

We are alive because we are rooted in undifferentiated spirit within the eternal realm. Words that followed the Word into the immortal sphere of the temporal, which is Heaven. Formless mists of spirit, we were immersed the temporal fire that bathes. We became angels, worms of imperishable fire.<br><br>The Angel of the Presence is charged with perfecting Creation; and to that end, we are his servants. We take form according to the task required of us; and a great many of us are sent to the mortal sphere of Creation to take form as mankind. Man is the fulcrum in which the conflicting dualities of Creation shall be overcome. We become spiritual warriors.</span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">In all its glory, Creation is moving to perfection by the hand of HaShem and the agency of HaMashiyach, the Angel of the Presence, the Lamb slain from the foundations of the world. Immortality came at a great cost, and we honor the Presence the Covering Cherub, the Son of man and of Elohim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">Heaven is the refiner’s furnace. It contains the throne of the Word, which is surrounded by the angelic host of subsequent words. Worms of thought that do not perish, we continually monitor the thoughts of HaShem as they are given expression by the Presence and reverberate in the chambers of our hearts.<br><br>We are divine caterpillars, and our immortal essence are imperishable worms of angelic fire that seep in knowledge of HaShem as we arise and fall in our dance upon Heaven’s Lake of Fire. The emanation of our eternal spirits into the temporal realm of Heaven was met with inertia that kindled spiritual fire, giving rise to the light of Creation and the sentience of man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">More than from genetics, the intelligence of man is a manifestation of spirit. The body, with its many faculties, does not generate sentience, but is its receptor, as it is written, “We hold this treasure in earthen vessels.”<br><br><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Man’s sentience rides the essence of the Breath of Life, which is the spiritual treasure that streams from the Father through the ductwork of the immortal worm of fire and into the bloodstream of the physical body, where it serves at the will and <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>pleasure of the indwelling tendrils of its root, which is the Breath of Life. <br><br>Our spirits, which are rooted within Elohim even at this moment, 
		participated in Creation; for the Spirit of HaShem is One. As they branched from the eternal realm to follow the Word into the temporal, however, they became differentiated. They were assigned differing tasks on behalf of the Kingdom of Heaven and therefore acquired specific angelic identities. The Realm of Names, with its temple made without hands, shall not appear in its fullness until that which is perfect arrives by the Wisdom of HaShem.<br><br>While in Heaven as angels, we retain our roots in the eternal realm; and while our angels visit the mortal sphere of Earth through incarnation, we retain our roots in the temporal realm’s immortal sphere. At incarnation, we are ritually clean at birth: we part the hoof between the two temporal spheres of the temporal; and as infants, we 
		chew the cud as we absorb the ambience of our lives on Earth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">The compounded errors born of inertia are confusing. They blind us to our true selves by drawing veils over our spiritual heritage; but among us, HaShem raises up those who have eyes to see. Buttressed by their inner vision, these Sons of Man meditate upon the invisible things of HaShem as they travel among us Their angels arise and fall again along the spinal column as they come and go, aiding the coming of the Sons of Man.<br><br>It is given to man, once, to die; and after that, the judgment and the alternatives that follow. When a man dies, he is no longer subject to the laws of man; for he is gathered to his fathers, each of which has its own laws: man’s spirit is eternal; his angel is immortal; his 
		imperfect soul is mortal but will put on immortality in perfection; his earthly body is mortal, and that great reward of the celestial body is covering for the angel’s immortal soul, all of which are enlightened by the unfiltered essence of HaShem.<br><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><br>As we arise from the waters of immersion on Earth, we acknowledge and embrace the immersions that accompanied us as we descended into earthly tabernacles. Although water baptism signals reversal, it is not repudiation. The baptism of Yahuchanan signals recognition and acceptance of the guiding hand of HaShem, in affirmation of the confession that we are unable to direct our own steps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">To repent is to confess to blindness. It’s good that we recall and acknowledge errors, asking forgiveness and guidance; but before we call, we are answered. While we were yet sinners, HaMashiyach laid down his life for us. From the foundations of the world his sacrifice sustains us on the path to perfection in the eyes of HaShem.<br><br>Like waves of the sea closing over the shore to measured distances and no further, our lives are a series of immersions. The present supplants the context of yesterday, and it prepares us for episodes we cannot presently foresee. Whether seamlessly or abruptly, we pass through milestones within reality; and we learn the meaning of “as above, so below” and of “no man has ascended 
		but he who first descended.” We are taught the faces of our pride because it preceded our many falls.<br><br>We fulfill all righteousness by water baptism through recognition of the consequences of life guided by our own understandings. The ritual signals acknowledgment that we are as dead, but for the life that comes from above. The sacrament seals our confession that we are unable to fathom the path that will bring us the true blessings of rest and peace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">.We war not against flesh and blood, nor even against wayward spirits. There is nothing without that can harm a man. The enemy lies within, but it is not a monster. The adversary is inertia. As the Teacher of Righteousness instructed us, “The sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was idle hands.” Inertia is a destructive weight that wraps itself around all things in every manifestation. <br><br>It is the pleasure of HaShem that we inherit the Realm of Names, but he reveals himself only at our invitation. Let us seek his faces; for if the iniquity of inertia is not countered by finger of God, we will fall ever more behind and will lapse into abomination. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The mysterious source of 
		iniquity, inertia wars against the spontaneity of life and seeks victory over the living by imposing portals of death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">The work of HaShem is a strange work. What personage or power can be said to be God’s enemy; for he has no equal? What force could resist him? Is the iniquity of inertia God’s foible, his nemesis? Is there a demi-god who can claim victory over life through the slight-of-hand called death? No.<br><br>HaShem is without adversary, and iniquity is the resistance that began in our eyes as they were dazzled by the wonders of Creation. HaShem is jealous of our attention; we will become lost in the universe without him; and that is the beginning of his works. He has promised that he will create all things new.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:black;mso-font-kerning:0pt;mso-ligatures:none;mso-fareast-language:ZH-CN">Inertia is the force of his finger against the thrust generated by Creation within our consciousness. It serves as wind against the sails of reality. With proper focus, it keeps the ship on its bearings as the seas and skies roar against the vessel and the rocks of shore lie in wait. Error lies in the choices of the helmsmen and the piracy of the masters to which they subject themselves, surrendering sovereignty within the mind of HaShem for slavery. <br><br>These times of ignorance, God winked at. HaShem creates and projects the force of life. He holds all life in his hands, but now he commands that we repent: that we put aside the doctrines of drunkenness from the distillery of the written word. Its letter is 
		poisonous, but when the lively oracles are enlarged by interpretation of his spirit, it becomes shewbread within the Living Temple. <br><br>HaShem nourishes and sustains living. He succors both the just and the unjust in the wisdom of his mercy. He prepares a table before us in the presence of our enemies so that we can find the peace we envisioned as our spirits emerged from the eternal realm to participate in Creation. <br><br>Father Yah </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:PaleoBora;
