		<td colspan="3">Zadok is the name of a priest, and the word tzaddiq, 
		which has many English spellings, means "just, righteous, a saint." As I 
		looked at these two sigils side-by-side I was struck by the idea that 
		individuals of this sort had two kindred, but different ways of focus: 
		different ways of looking at things, both inwardly and outwardly.<br />
		<br />
		The priest is wholly devoted to a focus on heavenly matters. He can 
		assist those who are already within the flock. He cares for the 
		faithfulness and understandings of those to whom he ministers. His 
		earthly footprint is small.<br />
		<br />
		The tzaddiq is certainly focused on heavenly matters; but he also opens 
		an outward focus, trained on the dimension he, himself, inhabits. He 
		allows himself the freedom to interact and to serve any he meets in the 
		natural course of his life, regardless of beliefs or piety.<br />
		<br />
		The priest practices bhakti yoga, as it were. The tzaddiq practices raja 
		yoga. The priest takes care that nobody can steal his crown. The tzaddiq 
		is willing to lose all in the service of any that comes within his 
		reach.&nbsp; His earthly footprint is large.</td>
